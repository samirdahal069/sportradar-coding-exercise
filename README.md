The project is a sports data application built using ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core. It includes components like a scoreboard service (ScoreboardService) that interacts with a inmemory database (ApplictionDBContext) to manage football match-related operations. The application allows users to perform actions such as starting new matches, updating match scores, finishing matches, and retrieving summaries of ongoing matches.

The solution follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, where the Match entity represents football matches, and the ScoreboardService encapsulates the business logic for managing match data. The application is designed to be simple, with a focus on the quality of code, adherence to SOLID principles, and considerations for test-driven development (TDD).

The project likely aims to provide a foundation for managing and displaying live football match data, allowing users to interact with and update match information through a web-based interface.
